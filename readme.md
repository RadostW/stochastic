Testing wiener: `g++ wiener_test.cpp -o wiener_test && ./wiener_test`

Ideas
- publish Wiener perfect sampling (code, theory, applications)
  - ask @MIM about applications
- publish comparison of fixed-step stochastic integrators (code, theory, applications)
- publish comparison of adaptive-step stochastic integrators (code, theory, applications)
- publish applications of adaptive-step stochastic integrators to molecular dynamics problems (code, theory, applications)
- explore a la Runge Kutta methods 
- more dirvatives in `tdouble`?
