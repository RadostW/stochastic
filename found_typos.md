Book: Numerical Solution of Stochastic Differential Equations
Peter E. Kloeden, Eckhard Platen
equation 5.8.11
 - In definition of D^p_j1j2j3: fourth summand should read \zeta_j1,r \eta_**j3**,l+r instead of **j1**.
 - In definition of b_j: there is a 1/\pi factor missing before sum.
 - In definition of C^p_j1j2: second term should be **+1/r**\eta_j1,r\eta_j2,l instead of **-l/r**

Tom R. Evensen, Stine N. Naess, Arnjolt Elgsaeter
equation 12
 - Prefactor of dyadic product matrix should read (1/f**2 - sin f / (2 f (1- cos f))), factor of 1/2 is misplaced
 - Last summand (proportional to identity + cross matrix) should be prefactored by 1/2

Paper: Rotational Brownian Dynamics simulations of clathrin cage formation
Ioana M. Ilie, Wouter K. den Otter, and Wim J. Briels
equation A16
 - First summand should be transposed
equation A15
 - First summand should be without the 1/2 factor
 - Second summand should be with the 1/2 factor
 - cos(a) should be replaced by (1 - a**2 /2)
