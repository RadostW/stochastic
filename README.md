# pychastic

All python stochastic differential equations solver.

Built for stochastic simulations of hydrodynamically interacting 
brownian particles (molecular dynamics), but can do much more 
(such as option pricing in stochastic volitality models).

Uses `jax`, `jax.jit` and `jax.grad` for performace and ease of use.
