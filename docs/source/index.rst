Pychastic is a user friendly oriented stochastic differential equation
integrator package for both scalar and vector stochastic differential
equations.

Stochastic differential equations find use in all places where "noise" is 
important part of the problem such as microscopic phenomena or pandemic
dynamics. The framework of Ito calculus gained somewhat mainstream 
attention since the model of Black-Sholes allowed for accurate pricing of
options.

How to install
''''''''''''''

Easiest way to get the package from PyPi is using pip. Simply run:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

  $ python3 -m pip install pychastic

and you'll be good to go.
